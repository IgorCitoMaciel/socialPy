# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
    ```
    .cursor/rules/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-rule-name.mdc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ another-rule.mdc
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ```

2. Follow the naming convention:
    - Use kebab-case for filenames
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:
    ```
    PROJECT_ROOT/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .cursor/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/
    ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-rule-name.mdc
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ```

4. Never place rule files:
    - In the project root
    - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
    - In any other location

5. Cursor rules have the following structure:

```
